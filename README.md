# CNAKE
## Snake game in C using SDL

### Compile:
You need to install SDL1.2, SDL_ttf and freetype first.
Then in root directory execute: `make`

### Run:
In root directory execute: `./bin/snake`

You can provide a custom window width: `./bin/snake <width>`

By default the window width is set in src/config.h 
The window height is calculated automatically.

### Config and custom map:
In src/config.h you can change the default window width and the default framerate (FRAME_TIME = 1/FRAMERATE)

In src/map.h you can edit the map. ' ' is a free space and 'x' is a wall.

The map size is 10x10 by default.

### Folder structure:
 - /bin/ contain the output binary file after compilation.
 - /build/ contain all .o files automatically generated by Makefile.
 - /lib/ contain the graphic library that is a wrapper of the SDL1.2 and the text font.
 - /src/ contain the source files of the game.
